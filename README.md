# Songs-Lyrics-Generator-Using-Markov-Chain
### A Markov chain is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the 
### previous event.
### A countably infinite sequence, in which the chain moves state at discrete time steps, gives a discrete-time Markov chain.
